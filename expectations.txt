I expect to learn a lot about Web Programming in CMSC 100. I also expect to learn more about the processes of how the websites I use are created. I only hear about the programming terms "front-end" and "back-end" in passing while scrolling through the internet, so it is quite exciting to actually learn about them in this course. While I don't expect everything to go smoothly as I go through this course, I expect to somewhat enjoy it nonetheless.

That is awesome!
